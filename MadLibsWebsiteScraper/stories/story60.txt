Dear [1], Today was my first day at [2]. It was so horrible! I only met [3] people...and very few of them seemed to strike up any intrest. A/ An [4] [5] called me a/an [6], and then this girl named [7] laughed at my [8] outfit. I can`t believe what happened today. Anyway, I did enjoy some of it. I met this one [9] named [10]. This person was super [11]. I think we`ll [12] become [13] [14]. Maybe tomorrow will be better. After all, it was only the first day. Well I think I will leave you with what one of my [15] said to me. " [16]"
