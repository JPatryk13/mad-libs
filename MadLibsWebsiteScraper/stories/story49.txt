Ladies and gentlemen of the [1] of [2]: Wear [3]. If I could offer you only one tip for the future, [3] would be it. The long-term benefits of [3] have been proven by [4], whereas the rest of my advice has no [5] more reliable than my own [6] experience. I will [7] this advice now. Don`t waste your time on [8].

Keep your old [15]; throw away your old [16]. [17]. Don`t feel [18] if you don`t know what you want to do with your life. The most [19] people I know didn`t know at [20] what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most [21] [21]-year-olds I know still don`t. Get plenty of [22]. Be kind to your [23] - you`ll miss them when they`re gone. Maybe you`ll [24], maybe you won`t. Maybe you`ll have [25], maybe you won`t. Maybe you`ll [26] at 40, maybe you`ll dance the [27] [28] on your 75th [29] anniversary. Whatever you do, don`t [30] yourself too much, or [31] yourself, either. Your choices are half [32]. So are everybody else`s. But trust me on the [3].
