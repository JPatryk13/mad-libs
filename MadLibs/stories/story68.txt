Ladies and gentlemen of the [1] of [2]: Wear [3]. If I could offer you only one tip for the future, [3] would be it. The long-term benefits of [3] have been proven by [4], whereas the rest of my advice has no [5] more reliable than my own [6] experience. I will [7] this advice now. Enjoy the [8] and [9] of your youth... oh, never mind. You will not understand the [10] and [11] of your youth until they`ve [10]. But trust me, in [11] years, you`ll look back at [12] of yourself and recall in a way you can`t [13] now how [14] you really looked. You are not as [15] as you imagine. Don`t worry about the [16]. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to [17] a/an [18] equation by [19] [20]. The real [21] in your life are apt to be things that never [22] your worried [23], the kind that [24] you at [25] on some [26] [27]. Do one thing every day that [28] you. [29]. Don`t be [30] with other people`s [31]. Don`t put up with people who are [34] with yours. [32]. Don`t waste your time on [33]. Sometimes you`re [34], sometimes you`re [35]; the [36] is long, and in the end, it`s only with your [37]. Remember [38] you receive. Forget the [39]. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how. Keep your old [40]; throw away your old [41]. [42]. Don`t feel [43] if you don`t know what you want to do with your life. The most [44] people I know didn`t know at [45] what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most [49] [46]-year-olds I know still don`t. Get plenty of [47]. Be kind to your [48] - you`ll miss them when they`re gone. Maybe you`ll [49], maybe you won`t. Maybe you`ll have [50], maybe you won`t. Maybe you`ll [51] at 40, maybe you`ll dance the [52] [53] on your 75th [54] anniversary. Whatever you do, don`t [55] yourself too much, or [56] yourself, either. Your choices are half [57]. So are everybody else`s. Enjoy your [58]. Use it in every way you can. Don`t be afraid of it or what other people think of it; it`s the greatest [59] you`ll ever own. [60]. Even if you have nowhere to do it but your [61]. Read the [62], even if you don`t [63] them. Do not read [64] magazines; they will only make you feel [65]. Get to know your [66]. You never know when they`ll be [67] for good. Be nice to your [68]. They`re your best link to your [69] and the people most likely to [70] with you in the [71]. Understand that friends [72] and [73], but with a/an [74] few, you should [75]. Work hard to [76] the gaps in [77] and [78], because the older you get, the more you need the [79] who [80] you when you were [81]. Live in [82] once, but leave before it makes you [83]. Live in [84] once, but leave before it makes you [85]. [86]. Accept certain [87] truths: [88] will rise, [89] will philander. You, too, will get [90]. And when you do, you`ll fantasize that when you were [91], [94] were reasonable, [95] were noble, and children respected their [92]. Respect your [100]. Don`t expect anyone else to [93] you. Maybe you`ll have a [94]; maybe you`ll have a/an [95] spouse. But you never know when either one might [96]. Don`t mess too much with your [97] or by the time you`re [98] it will look [99]. Be careful whose advice you [100], but be patient with those who [101] it. Advice is a form of [102]; [103] is a way of fishing the [104] from the [105], wiping it off, [106] over the [107] parts, and [108] it for more than it`s worth. But trust me on the [3].
