I am Dr. [1]. I am destined to [2] the [3]. Unfortunately, the [3] is full of a bunch of [4] [5] that do not agree. So this is my [6] plan to take over the [3]: To start with, I`ll need to build my [7] hideout in an abandoned [8] complex in the middle of the [9]. It will have [10] underground floor(s), and only [11] floor(s) aboveground. All the [12] will open [13] and address me as " The Great and [14] Dr. [1]". I will also have several rooms designed for [15] and [16] anyone who tries to [17] me. That is, after I have [18] the full extent of my [7] plan to them. Next, I will hire some [19] to design the [20] Buster, a machine designed to trigger huge [21] wherever I want it to. And if they don`t want to build it, I will capture their [22] and threaten to make them [23] for hours on end. Once it`s built, I will have it [24] along the San Andreas [25]. Mw [26], [30], [30], [30], [30]! Obviously you [27], I can hold the Govenor of [28], [29], against the threat of [30] [31] of the state into the ocean. And once I have control of [36], I will [32] the [33] industry into promoting my right to [2] the [3], and [34] all will succumb to my [35] and [36].
