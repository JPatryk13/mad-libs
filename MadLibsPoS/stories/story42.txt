The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was [7]: If it were so, it was a grievous [8]; And grievously hath Caesar [9] it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,-- For Brutus is a/an [10] man; So are they all, all [10] men,-- Come I to [11] in Caesar`s funeral.

I [12] not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to [12] what I do know.
