Traffic [1], signals, and pavement [2] do not always resolve traffic conflicts. A/ An [3] light, for example, does not resolve the conflict between a/an [4] turning left at a/an [5] while an oncoming [4] is going straight through. The right-of- [6] rules help resolve these kinds of conflicts. They tell drivers who goes [7] and who must [8] in different situations.- A driver approaching a/an [5] must [9] the right-of- [7] to [10] already lawfully using the [5].- If drivers approaching from [11] directions reach a/an [5] at about the same time, a driver [12] must [13] to approaching [13] going straight or [17].- At a/an [5] not controlled by [1] or signals, or where [14] or more drivers stop at S T O P [1] at the same time and they are at [15] angles to one another, the driver on the left must [11] the right-of- [7] to the driver on the right.- A vehicle [16] a/an [17] from a driveway, [18], [19] road, or any other place that is not a/an [29], must stop and [18] the right-of- [7] to [13] on the [29], and to pedestrians.- Drivers must [11] to pedestrians [20] using marked or unmarked [21].- You may not enter a/an [5] if [13] are backed up on the other side and you cannot get all the way through the [5]. Wait until [13] ahead [22], so you do not block the [5].- A driver entering a traffic [23], sometimes called a/an [24], must [18] the right-of- [7] to drivers already in the [46].
