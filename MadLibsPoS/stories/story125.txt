While working in [6] production, I often relied on [2] to put together [7] presentations, for which she described and [8] the artistic approach to the project, researching [9] and photographic [10] materials. Her creativity, resourcefulness and ability to see a project through really made these presentations [11] and [12]. When we went into production on the feature film [13], [2] was able to observe every [14] of the process, [15] in on meetings and working with [16] in all areas of the production from the moment the production was set in motion through the release of the film [17] later. During this time, she was an [18] [19], often serving as my liason to scattered [20] of the crew. She also coordinated projects involving [21] people, and her ability to work [22] while guiding the project quickly and [23] was [24].

She even [28] in to draw a few last-minute [29] changes herself. [2]`s sensitivity, [30], energy and sense of [31] made working with her a/an [32]. I highly recommend her as a/an [33] addition to the program. Sincerely, [34]
