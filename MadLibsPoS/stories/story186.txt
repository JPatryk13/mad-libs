Two [1], both alike in dignity, In fair [2], where we lay our scene, From ancient [3] break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross`d [4] take their life; Whole misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their [5] bury their parents` strife.
