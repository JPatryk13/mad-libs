Superman is the sole [1] of the planet Krypton. His father, Jor- El, discovered that a [2] chain reaction was building inside Krypton that would soon [3] the entire world. Jor- El therefore had his [4] son Kal- El removed from the Kryptonian Gestation Chambers and affixed the life [5] containing Kal- El to an experimental vessel for travel through hyperspace. Jor- El launched the starcraft toward [6] just before Krypton exploded. Superman was, in effect, born on [6] when the starcraft landed there. Jonathan and Martha Kent found the [7] inside the vessel and brought him to their farm in [8]ville, Kansas. Since he appeared entirely human, the Kents assumed that the [8] was a victim of a cruel experiment. At this time the [8] had no super powers. The Kents named the [8] Clark and raised him as their own son. Clark initially used his powers [9] to help people and prevent or thwart [10]. Ultimately, he was [11] to use his powers in public to prevent the crash of a N A S A [12]. Thereafter he and his foster [13] devised a new costumed secret identity he would [14] when using his abilities in public. They called his new persona " Superman," the name given him by [15], a reporter for the Metropolis Daily [16] who had been aboard the [16]. Shortly afterward, Clark obtained a job as a [17] for the Daily [20] by turning in his first [18] story about Superman. He currently enjoys a [19] status with the [20]. He possesses a tremendous [20]; while Superman`s [27] is not infinite, its full extent is so great that it has never been [21] measured. His body is virtually [22]. Superman`s sharp senses enable him to hear sounds too [23] to be detected by the normal human [24]. His "telescopic vision" enables him to focus his sight on [25] [26] far beyond the range of normal [27] sight. His " [28] vision" allows him to observe an object in [36] detail. Superman`s so called " [29]-ray vision" enables him to [30] clearly through solid objects. Certain dense [31], notably [32], obstruct this ability. His power to generate [33] within objects manifests itself as a [34] glow within his [35], and is therefore known as " [42] vision." Superman can move, react, and think at super [36] speeds greater than that of [37]. He can defy gravity and [38] through force of will. Superman`s irradiated cells generate a force [39] that extends for a fraction of an [40] around his body, [41] any material within the field nearly [30], such as his skin [42] costume.
